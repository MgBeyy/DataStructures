Palindrome Detector
=====================

A palindrome is an expression that reads correctly in both directions (right to left and left to right). 


#### Write: 
A program that uses a stack to check for palindromes in each line of a text file. The example text file is taken from 'assignment.txt'. Your program should extract the palindromes it finds in the document. 


#### For example
```
"a man, a plan, a canal, Panama" is a palindrome.
"Don't nod" is a palindrome.
"Taco Cat!" is a palindrome.

```
- You should write your own 'MyStack' class for this problem. Do not use the built-in Stack class.
- You are free to use a LinkedList, ArrayList or an array to implement a Stack.
